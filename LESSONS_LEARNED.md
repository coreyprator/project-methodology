## 2024-12 Lessons (v3.5)

### LL-001: VS Code AI Didn't Create Database User

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date | 2024-12-27 |
| Project | ArtForge |
| Issue | VS Code AI generated code expecting database user, but never created the user in SQL Server |
| Root Cause | Responsibility for database user creation was not explicitly assigned |
| Fix Applied | Added "Create database & user in SQL" to VS Code AI responsibilities in the Responsibility Matrix |
| Template Section | Phase 1: Responsibility Matrix |

**Impact**: Deployment failed with authentication errors. Required manual intervention to create the database user.

---

### LL-002: Password Prompt Blocking GCP Commands

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date | 2024-12-27 |
| Project | ArtForge |
| Issue | `gcloud config set project` prompted for password, blocking automated workflows |
| Root Cause | Authentication order was wrong—project was set before browser auth completed |
| Fix Applied | Created Phase 0 with explicit authentication order. Added warning about password prompts. |
| Template Section | Phase 0: Pre-Kickoff Setup, Section 0.1 |

**Impact**: VS Code AI couldn't proceed with gcloud commands. User had to manually intervene with authentication.

**Key Learning**: The correct order is:
1. `gcloud auth login` (browser/Passkey)
2. `gcloud auth application-default login`
3. `gcloud config set project` (should NOT prompt)
4. `gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project`

---

### LL-003: Wrong GCP Project Selected

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date | 2024-12-27 |
| Project | ArtForge |
| Issue | Commands ran against wrong GCP project, creating resources in unexpected location |
| Root Cause | Project was not verified at the start of the session |
| Fix Applied | Added project verification step after authentication |
| Template Section | Phase 0: Pre-Kickoff Setup, Section 0.2 |

**Impact**: Had to clean up resources from wrong project and recreate in correct project.

---

### LL-004: "Project Does Not Exist" Errors

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date | 2024-12-27 |
| Project | HarmonyLab (planning) |
| Issue | Kickoff document referenced GCP project that hadn't been created yet |
| Root Cause | Decision to use new vs. existing project wasn't made upfront |
| Fix Applied | Added pre-kickoff questions about GCP project choice |
| Template Section | Pre-Kickoff Checklist (separate document) |

**Impact**: Wasted time debugging "project not found" errors that were actually planning issues.

---

### LL-005: SQL Scripts Failed in Cloud SQL Studio

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date | 2024-12-27 |
| Project | ArtForge |
| Issue | SQL scripts with GO statements failed in Cloud SQL Studio |
| Root Cause | Cloud SQL Studio doesn't support GO batch separator |
| Fix Applied | Added SQL Execution Environment section specifying which tool to use |
| Template Section | Phase 0: Pre-Kickoff Setup, Section 0.3 |

**Impact**: Schema creation failed. Had to re-run scripts in SSMS.

**Key Learning**: 
- SSMS/sqlcmd: Full T-SQL support including GO
- Cloud SQL Studio: Single statements only

---

### LL-006: VS Code AI Ran Localhost Server

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date | 2024-12-27 |
| Project | ArtForge |
| Issue | VS Code AI started local development server with `uvicorn` instead of deploying to Cloud Run |
| Root Cause | Default developer workflow is local-first; cloud-first not documented |
| Fix Applied | Added "NO LOCALHOST SERVERS" section with cloud-first workflow diagram |
| Template Section | Phase 0: Pre-Kickoff Setup, Section 0.4 |

**Impact**: Testing was done against localhost, then failed on Cloud Run due to environment differences.

**Key Learning**: The workflow is always: Write → Push → Deploy → Test on Cloud Run URL

---

### LL-007: Git Repository Not Initialized

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date | 2024-12-27 |
| Project | ArtForge |
| Issue | VS Code AI generated code but didn't initialize git or push to GitHub |
| Root Cause | Git initialization wasn't in the task list |
| Fix Applied | Added git init, remote add, commit, push to VS Code AI responsibilities |
| Template Section | Phase 1: Responsibility Matrix |

**Impact**: Code sat locally; GitHub Actions never triggered.

---

### LL-008: No Test Plan Created

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date | 2024-12-27 |
| Project | ArtForge |
| Issue | Sprint 1 completed but no tests existed and no plan for what to test |
| Root Cause | TEST_PLAN.md wasn't a required deliverable |
| Fix Applied | Added TEST_PLAN.md to Claude's required deliverables; added to Sprint 1 DoD |
| Template Section | Phase 1: Responsibility Matrix, Phase 3: Sprint 1 DoD |

**Impact**: Sprint 2 started without clarity on what needed testing.

---

### LL-009: No UI Design Document

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date | 2024-12-27 |
| Project | ArtForge |
| Issue | Frontend development started without any UI design specification |
| Root Cause | UI_DESIGN.md wasn't a required deliverable |
| Fix Applied | Added UI_DESIGN.md to Claude's required deliverables |
| Template Section | Phase 1: Responsibility Matrix |

**Impact**: Frontend had to be reworked multiple times due to unclear requirements.

---

### LL-010: Users Confused by Application

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date | 2024-12-27 |
| Project | ArtForge |
| Issue | Users didn't understand how to use the application |
| Root Cause | No user documentation existed |
| Fix Applied | Added USER_GUIDE.md to Claude's required deliverables |
| Template Section | Phase 1: Responsibility Matrix |

**Impact**: Support burden on developer; users abandoned application.

---

### LL-011: Technical Errors Exposed to Users

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date | 2024-12-27 |
| Project | ArtForge |
| Issue | Users saw errors like `NoneType has no attribute 'id'` |
| Root Cause | No guidelines for user-friendly error messages |
| Fix Applied | Added Testing Philosophy section with error message guidelines |
| Template Section | Phase 4: Sprint 2, Section 4.1 |

**Impact**: Users confused by technical errors; poor user experience.

**Key Learning**:
- Happy path errors: User-friendly messages
- System errors: Can bubble up (users have AI to explain)

---

### LL-012: Help Content Embedded in Application

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date | 2024-12-27 |
| Project | ArtForge |
| Issue | Help documentation was embedded in React components |
| Root Cause | No strategy defined for help content |
| Fix Applied | Changed to external link strategy—help links to GitHub docs |
| Template Section | Phase 4: Sprint 2, Section 4.2 |

**Impact**: Every documentation fix required a full redeploy.

**Key Learning**: External help links allow doc updates without app deployment.

## 2024-12 Lessons (v3.6)

### LL-013: VS Code AI Delegated Automation to Project Lead

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date | 2024-12-28 |
| Project | HarmonyLab |
| Issue | VS Code AI told Project Lead to manually create secrets and run gcloud commands instead of automating |
| Root Cause | Responsibility matrix listed tasks but didn't emphasize automation over instruction |
| Fix Applied | Added "Responsibility Matrix Clarification" section; created cloud migration script template |
| Template Section | Phase 1: Responsibility Matrix, Appendix C: Cloud Migration Script |

**Impact**: Project Lead had to repeatedly redirect VS Code AI to automate tasks. Slowed migration by 2+ hours.

**Key Learning**: 
- VS Code AI must execute, not instruct
- Provide executable script templates, not command lists
- The only manual step is Passkey authentication (Phase 0.1)
