## Pre-Kickoff Verification

Before starting, verify these are complete:

### Authentication (Project Lead does this)

- [ ] Logged into Google Cloud Console in browser
- [ ] GitHub authenticated with Passkey
- [ ] VS Code signed into GitHub

### GCP Authentication (Run in terminal)

```powershell
# Run these commands in order:
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud config set project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]

# Verify:
gcloud config get-value project
```

> ⚠️ If `gcloud config set project` prompts for a password, STOP and run `gcloud auth login` again.

### Repository (if creating new)

- [ ] GitHub repo created at github.com
- [ ] Repo is empty (no README, no .gitignore)
- [ ] Visibility set (public/private)

### OAuth (if needed)

- [ ] Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials
- [ ] OAuth 2.0 Client ID created
- [ ] Authorized redirect URIs will include Cloud Run URL (add after first deploy)

## Ready for Kickoff

Once all questions are answered and verifications complete:

**Command to Claude:**
> "Generate kickoff for [PROJECT_NAME] with these inputs:
> - GitHub: [URL]
> - GCP Project: [ID]
> - Database: [name] on [instance]
> - External APIs: [list]
> - Storage: [bucket or none]
> - Domain: [custom or Cloud Run]"

Claude will then generate:
1. Customized PROJECT_KICKOFF document
2. TEST_PLAN.md
3. UI_DESIGN.md  
4. USER_GUIDE.md
