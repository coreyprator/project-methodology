## [3.10.2] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- **LL-030**: Developer Tests Before Handoff - Universal Principle (applies to ALL work, not just Sprint 1)
- **Developer Tests Before Handoff** (PROJECT_KICKOFF_TEMPLATE.md): Universal section covering frontend, API, database, scripts, bug fixes
- **Self-Verification Requirements**: Matrix of what to verify for each work type
- **Handoff Report Template**: Required format when requesting Project Lead review

### Changed
- Moved handoff testing requirements from Sprint 1 to universal Phase 1 section
- Updated VIOLATION_RESPONSE.md quick reference with 5 new violation types (LL-025 through LL-030)

### Key Insight

**LL-030: Developer Tests Before Handoff**
> Do not hand off ANY work for review until you have tested it yourself. This applies to frontend, API, database, scripts, bug fixes—everything. Project Lead's time is for reviewing WORKING code, not debugging errors you should have caught.

---

## [3.10.1] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- **LL-029**: Session Start Authentication - Human Responsibility
- **Session Start Script** (PROJECT_KICKOFF_TEMPLATE.md Phase 0.1): Reusable PowerShell script for GCP auth
- **AI Behavior When Blocked** (PROJECT_KICKOFF_TEMPLATE.md Phase 0.1): Clear protocol for password prompt encounters
- **Re-Authentication Triggers**: Documented when tokens expire and re-auth is needed

### Key Insight

**LL-029: Session Start Authentication**
> GCP auth is human-only. Browser/Passkey authentication cannot be done by AI. If AI encounters password prompt: STOP, request re-auth, wait for confirmation.

---

## [3.10.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- **EXTERNAL_API_HANDLING.md**: New guide for persisting temporary API resources immediately
- **Code Delivery Standards** (PROJECT_KICKOFF_TEMPLATE.md): Always provide complete files, never diffs
- **Version Control Best Practices** (PROJECT_KICKOFF_TEMPLATE.md): Push at logical checkpoints
- **Bug Fix Verification: Test the Code Path** (PROJECT_KICKOFF_TEMPLATE.md Appendix D): Must test the broken code, not just fix data
- **LL-025**: External API temporary resources must be persisted immediately (DALL-E URLs expire in 2hrs)
- **LL-026**: Always provide complete files, never diffs or snippets
- **LL-027**: Test the code path that caused a bug before fixing the data it created
- **LL-028**: Git push at logical checkpoints, not only when asked

### Changed
- **Appendix D Error Recovery**: Expanded with "Test the Code Path" section
- **Appendix E**: Added EXTERNAL_API_HANDLING.md reference

### Key Insights

**LL-025: Persist Immediately**
> NEVER store temporary URLs in persistent database fields. Download and persist to YOUR storage immediately.

**LL-026: No Diffs**
> Extra seconds to generate complete file saves significant debugging time. AI token costs are trivial compared to human merge-error debugging.

**LL-027: Test the Code Path**
> If you don't exercise the exact code path that was broken, you don't actually know if your fix works.

**LL-028: Push at Checkpoints**
> Unpushed code is unprotected code. Push after fixes, features, sessions—minimum daily.

## [3.9.0] - 2026-01-01

### Added
- **VIOLATION_RESPONSE.md**: New template for handling methodology violations with standard response protocol
- **VERIFICATION_GOVERNANCE.md**: Golden Audit governance model - truth sources owned by Architect, read-only for VS Code
- **UNICODE_HANDLING.md**: Encoding requirements for non-ASCII data (Python + SQL Server)
- **Pre-Work Checklist** (PROJECT_KICKOFF_TEMPLATE.md): Mandatory documentation review before coding
- **Automation Requirements** (PROJECT_KICKOFF_TEMPLATE.md): Positive instructions (what TO DO) instead of just prohibitions
- **Appendix D: Error Recovery Protocol** (PROJECT_KICKOFF_TEMPLATE.md): STOP → PRESERVE → ISOLATE → VERIFY → APPLY
- **Phase 5.5: Mandatory Testing Sequence** (SPRINT_1_CHECKLIST.md): Smoke → Unit → Small Batch → Bulk
- **Bulk Operation Checklist** (SPRINT_1_CHECKLIST.md): Required verification before bulk operations
- **LL-018 through LL-024**: Seven lessons from Etymython Sprint 3-4

### Changed
- **Responsibility Matrix Clarification**: Now includes pre-work checklist and positive automation instructions
- **Sprint 1 Checklist**: Added testing sequence and bulk operation requirements

### Key Insights

**LL-018: RTFM**
> AI agents must be explicitly required to read documentation before coding.

**LL-019: Automation First**
> State what TO DO (one correct choice), not what NOT to do (infinite wrong choices).

**LL-020: External Verification**
> The programmer cannot grade their own test. Golden Audit = single source of truth.

**LL-022: Unit Before Bulk**
> NEVER skip from "code written" to "bulk execution".

**LL-023: Unicode Handling**
> String comparison doesn't catch encoding bugs. Always verify with UNICODE() values.

**LL-024: Error Recovery**
> Each "fix" attempt can make data worse. Stop and plan before acting.

## [3.8.0] - 2025-12-31

### Added
- **BACKUP_VERIFICATION.md**: New template with automated PowerShell script to verify all Cloud SQL backups
- **Database Backup & DR section** (SPRINT_1_CHECKLIST.md): Required backup configuration before user testing
- **Backup Configuration section** (DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md): Verification that backups are enabled and successful
- **Backup questions** (PRE_KICKOFF_CHECKLIST.md): Retention period, PITR, and backup window decisions
- **LL-017**: Database backups must be verified, not assumed

### Changed
- **Sprint 1 Definition of Done**: Now requires "Database backups enabled and verified"
- **README.md**: Added "Backups Verified" principle

### Key Insight
> **Backups must be verified, not assumed.**
> 
> Every database needs: automated backups enabled, PITR for production, retention period set, and at least one successful backup completed.

---

## [3.7.0] - 2025-12-30

### Added
- **Smoke Test Template** (SMOKE_TEST_TEMPLATE.md): Layered smoke tests to verify deployment works before user testing
- **Phase 6: Smoke Testing** (SPRINT_1_CHECKLIST.md): Required verification phase between deployment and user testing
- **Test Types and Purposes** (PROJECT_KICKOFF_TEMPLATE.md): Clarifies smoke vs unit vs integration tests
- **Testing Sequence for New Features**: Write code → Deploy → Smoke test → User test → Unit tests
- **LL-014**: Smoke tests required before user testing (ArtForge "Internal Server Error" incident)
- **LL-015**: Smoke tests vs unit tests serve different purposes
- **LL-016**: Testing phase sequence for new vs existing features

### Changed
- **Sprint 1 Definition of Done**: Now requires smoke tests pass, no 500 errors, user can load app
- **Testing Philosophy**: Added test type matrix and sequence guidance

### Fixed
- "Deployed" being confused with "Working"
- Unit tests blocking deployment when behavior was never verified
- Users discovering 500 errors instead of automated tests catching them

### Key Insight
> **"Deployed" ≠ "Working"**
> 
> Smoke tests fill the gap between deployment and user testing by verifying the deployed app actually works.
